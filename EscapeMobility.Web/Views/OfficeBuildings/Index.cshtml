    Is your company prepared for an emergency?
    In the busy daily practice of your office you probably do not give much thought to the possibility that an emergency may occur; but a fire may start, an accident may happen or an earthquake might strike.

    At that moment, it is important that you act quickly and that you have all the required equipment, within easy reach. In 95% of disasters the elevators cannot be used and office buildings usually have a very diverse make up of people working and visiting on a daily basis.

    We offer a wide range of evacuation and emergency response products especially designed for offices.
    Please select the desired category from the list located on the left.
    We recommend:

    Escape-Chair Standard Plus:
    A step forward in terms of versatility and comfort from the more basic Escape-Chairs:
    double ergonomic back support (more comfortable for persons that are disabled supporting themselves with their upper/lower lumbar area)
    operator handle has two levels (normal and high, latter to be used for tall persons that operate the chair)
    suitable for low, medium and high rise buildings
    padded headrest
    comfort seating (fixated at more points to the frame)
    enamel coated and only 2 lbs heavier than the ALU.
    We recommend this chair when there’s the possibility that persons that are disabled have to be evacuated.
