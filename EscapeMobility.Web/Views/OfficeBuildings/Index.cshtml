    <h2>Is your company prepared for an emergency?</h2>
    <p>In the busy daily practice of your office you probably do not give much thought to the possibility that an emergency may occur; but a fire may start, an accident may happen or an earthquake might strike.</p>

    <p>At that moment, it is important that you act quickly and that you have all the required equipment, within easy reach. In 95% of disasters the elevators cannot be used and office buildings usually have a very diverse make up of people working and visiting on a daily basis.</p>

    <p>
        We offer a wide range of evacuation and emergency response products especially designed for offices.
        Please select the desired category from the list located on the left.
    </p>

    <h3>We recommend:</h3>

    <h2 data-clickable="@Url.Action(MVC.OfficeBuildings.EscapeChair())">Escape-Chair Standard Plus:</h2>
    A step forward in terms of versatility and comfort from the more basic Escape-Chairs:
    <ul>
        <li>double ergonomic back support (more comfortable for persons that are disabled supporting themselves with their upper/lower lumbar area)</li>
        <li>operator handle has two levels (normal and high, latter to be used for tall persons that operate the chair)</li>
        <li>suitable for low, medium and high rise buildings</li>
        <li>padded headrest</li>
        <li>comfort seating (fixated at more points to the frame)</li>
        <li>enamel coated and only 2 lbs heavier than the ALU.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We recommend this chair when there’s the possibility that persons that are disabled have to be evacuated.</p>
