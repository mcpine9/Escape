    <p></p><h2>Is your educational institute prepared sufficiently for an emergency? </h2>
    Within the education environment, more often than not, there are individual students that require more assistance than others, amongst the student population. For example,&nbsp;they may have&nbsp;some form of&nbsp;disability. <br>
    <br>
    In the event of an emergency, these particular students are very vulnerable, as they tend to rely on using the elevator. <br>
    <br>
    Make sure that these groups of students can also leave the building quickly and safely, in the event of an emergency. We, at Escape Mobility Company, know better than anyone&nbsp;else&nbsp;what&nbsp;support the educational&nbsp;environment really&nbsp;needs. We offer a wide range of evacuation and emergency response products especially suited&nbsp;for educational institutions. Please select the desired category from the list&nbsp;on the left. <br><p></p>
